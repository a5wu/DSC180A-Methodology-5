**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
- The most interesting topic covered in the domain to me is graph transformers and how they don't have to follow the message passing framework. It's interesting because there are many different types of graph transformers and many different ways to encode positional information. 
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
- I would like to explore the viability of graph transformers in recommender systems, particularly in large social networks like Bluesky. 
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
- For our quarter 1 project, we replicate studies and confirm our knowledge on various graph learning models. For the quarter 2 project, I would like to focus on graph transformer models and their performance in recommender systems. We would like to focus on the performance of these models on large social networks like Bluesky. We are primarily interested in Bluesky first but we also plan on testing our models on other social networks such as reddit, hackernews, and more.
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
- I am also interested in using modified GNNs and comparing their performance and speed to graph transformers. I also want to use our models and explore their ability to construct useful knowledge graphs.
